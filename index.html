        Hello! I'm Elizar Gimenez, a software developer based in Cebu. I have a
        Diploma in Computer Engineering Technology from CITE Technical Inc. and
        over a year of experience in the tech industry, working with a range of
        programming languages including JavaScript, Python, C, and PHP. Moreover,
        I also utilize different frameworks such as ReactJS for front-end and 
        Django and Flask for back-end while Postgres for the database.
      </span>
      <span id="about">
        I specialize in full-stack development and have a passion for creating
        intuitive, user-friendly, and functional application. I love the
        challenge of solving complex problems and the satisfaction that comes
        from building something from scratch. When I'm not coding, you can find
        me exploring the great outdoors, experimenting with photography and
        traveling, learning the instruments, and gaining knowledge from book,
        blogs, videos, article and other curricular literature. Interested in
        working together or learning more? Feel free to contact me.
